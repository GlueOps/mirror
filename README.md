# mirror
A repo that we use to mirror all of our github images from various registries such as ghcr.io, quay.io, docker.io


Everything is accessible here:
- http://github.com/glueops/mirror/packages
- https://quay.io/organization/glueops

_NOTE_: For github/GHCR each newly added package must be made public manually and the permissions should be updated so that it "inherits access from the source repository"
